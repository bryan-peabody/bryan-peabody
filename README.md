- 👋 Hi, I’m @bryan-peabody
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to interact with programming languages and people.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying for my CIS degree at UMA.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on something useful that I care about, once I get to the point where I would actually be useful.
- 📫 How to reach me ... Unfortunately, due to my location, I can't communicate with others, and I can't be reached, for now.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him/His
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've had an obsession with technology my entire life, but never had the chance to explore it until recently.
